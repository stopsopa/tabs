# Doc mostly outdated

Documentation was created for old version of this component created back in 2015 based on jQuery.
I'll update it later

Current [version](https://stopsopa.github.io/tabs/) was rewritten to use to use vanilla [event delegation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Event_bubbling#event_delegation) technique
.

# versions

## latest (not recommended to use)

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://stopsopa.github.io/tabs/vanilla-tabs.css"
/>
<script src="https://stopsopa.github.io/tabs/vanilla-tabs.js?vanilla-tabs-autoenable"></script>
// presence of 'vanilla-tabs-autoenable' in query string triggers autobinding
and watch mode // so next section is not needed (.bind(), .active(),
.watchMutationsEnable())

<script>
  const unbind = vanillaTabs.bind();
  vanillaTabs.active();

  // that will trigger .activate() everytime new [data-buttons]
  // will be created anywhere in the document
  vanillaTabs.watchMutationsEnable();
</script>
```
